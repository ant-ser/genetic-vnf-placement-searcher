## About The Project
_A genetic algorithm for efficiently solving the Multi-flavored VNF Chain Placement Problem._

This algorithm subjects a starting population to an iterative process of selection and alteration in order to obtain one or more suitable solutions for the above-mentioned problem, as formulated in:

The fitness value associated with an individual is proportional to the profit generated by requests for services it considers accepted. The genetic operators are designed to take into account the specific characteristics of the problem under consideration.

The genetic algorithm presents some additional features, which could improve its effectiveness. First, the genetic algorithm is elitist, that is it can allow the best individuals in the current population to join, without alteration, the population of the next generation. In addition, the algorithm offers the possibility of introducing a number of preexisting solutions within the initial population by scanning a specially formatted file.
